# Module 2 – easy_drinks

## What is covered

- creating a database and a table
- choosing appropriate data types
- inserting multiple rows of data
- preparing data for basic SELECT queries
- filtering with `WHERE`
- comparison operators (`=`, `<>`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`)
- logical operators (`AND`, `OR`)
- range filtering with BETWEEN / NOT BETWEEN
- pattern matching with LIKE / NOT LIKE
- filtering sets of values using IN / NOT IN
- handling NULL values with IS NULL / IS NOT NULL

## Files

- `easy_drinks.sql` – creates the `easy_drinks` table and inserts sample data
    The exercise uses a simple drinks dataset that is later queried using
    `SELECT` and `WHERE` statements.
- `queries.sql` - example `SELECT` queries using `WHERE` clauses and comparison operators, logical operators (AND/OR), and additional filtering techniques such as BETWEEN, LIKE, IN, and NULL handling.

  ## Notes
  This module focuses on filtering and searching data using the SELECT statement with WHERE clauses.
  It introduces comparison operators, logical operators, range filtering, pattern matching, set-based filtering, and proper handling of NULL values.
