# Module 2 – easy_drinks

## What is covered

- creating a database and a table
- choosing appropriate data types
- inserting multiple rows of data
- preparing data for basic SELECT queries
- filtering with `WHERE`
- comparison operators (`=`, `<>`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`)
- logical operators (`AND`, `OR`)

## Files

- `easy_drinks.sql` – creates the `easy_drinks` table and inserts sample data
    The exercise uses a simple drinks dataset that is later queried using
    `SELECT` and `WHERE` statements.
- `queries.sql` - example `SELECT` queries using `WHERE` clauses and comparison operators, and logical operators (AND/OR).

  ## Notes
  This module focuses on learning how to filter and search data effectively using `WHERE` conditions.
