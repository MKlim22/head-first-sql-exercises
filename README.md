# Head First SQL - Modul 1

This repository contains my practise work based on the book 'Head First SQL'.
Modul 1 focuses on the basics of SQL table creation and simple table modifications.

## Lesson 1: Basic Table Creation

- Creates the 'gregs_list' database (if it does not exist).
- Creates the 'my_contacts' table.
- Uses basic data types such as 'VARCHAR' AND 'DATE'.
- Demonstrates how to safely drop and recreate tables to avoid errors when running scripts multiple times.
- Verifies table creation using 'SHOW TABLES' and 'DESC'.

## Lesson 2: Adding a New Column (Gender)

- Modifies the 'my_contacts' table by adding a new column: 'gender CHAR(1)'.
- Demonstrates how table structure can be updated by dropping and recreating a table.
- Uses 'DESC my_contacts' to inspet the updated table structure.

## Lesson 3: NOT NULL Constraint and Data Insertion

- Create the table with 'NOT NULL' constraints.
- Inserts a sample record into the table, showing how to provide values for all required fields.
- Uses 'SELECT * FROM my_contacts' to verify the inserted data.
