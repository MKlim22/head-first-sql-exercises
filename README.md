# Head First SQL – Exercises

This repository contains my SQL practice based on the book  
**"Head First SQL"**.

The goal of this repository is to document my learning process and keep
my SQL exercises structured and easy to revisit.

## Structure

- **M1** – Basic table creation and simple table modifications  
- **M2** – Creating tables and inserting data (easy_drinks exercise)

Each module has its own folder and README with a short description
of the covered topics.

> This is a learning repository, not a portfolio project.
